                    <p> Dealing with computers was one of my favorite things I like doing. In short, I generally love technology and how it keeps on changing day in day out.
                        I feel in love with programming because I needed to how websites are created because one of my goals in life is to create a website that will help people 
                        and be able to transform people's life.
